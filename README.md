  - https://idratherbewriting.com/events-and-listeners-javascript/ - We used this site to learn about the click me method that helped us tally the votes.
  - We also received help from our professor especially with strategizing how to tally the votes.

Does GitHub show that both partners contributed substantially to the code?
  - Yes.
  - Note: say something about what you're changing in your commit messages. Just "changes" isn't very informative.
 
Does the page allow a poll to be created with one question and multiple answers?
  - Yes.

After the poll has been created, does the page allow votes to be cast?
  - Yes.

After votes have been cast, does the page allow them to be tallied?
  - Yes.

Is the user interface intuitive and easy to use?
  - Multiple buttons labeled "Submit" could be confusing.
  - The "Submit" and "Edit Question" buttons at the top seem redundant.
  - It would be nice if the input boxes were longer so they could show more text at a time.
  - It would be nice to have clear confirmation that a vote has been cast successfully.
  - It would be nice if the winning result were highlighted in some way.

Is the page tolerably styled with Bootstrap?
  - It would be nice if the vote buttons lined up.
  - It would be nice if the results lined up.
  - It's a little odd that the results are buttons.
